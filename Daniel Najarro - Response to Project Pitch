Response to Project Pitch - Suggest a Laptop

I like this project idea because this is the sort of thing I would have liked to have when I was looking into buying a laptop recently. 
I like that it can theoretically be as simple or complex as we want to make it by adding more websites to scrape from. 
I don’t have experience with webscraping, but I’m willing to learn.

Business
I like the 3 phases that you mention in the project pitch.

Legal
I don’t see any legal issues besides the one mentioned in the project pitch about ads and sponsors.

Technical
I have very little experience with JavaScript but I’m willing to work on a NodeJS backend because I want to get more experience 
working in JavaScript. MySQL seems like a good option for a SQL database and should work well with NodeJS as far as I can tell. 
As for a frontend language, I’m open to whatever, although I’m most familiar with Java and Python.
